Thunderbird for Android version 11.0b5, based on K-9 Mail. Changes include:
- TalkBack did not clearly announce contact picture tap action
- IMAP push could fail after losing and regaining network connection
- Fastmail OAuth expired quickly, causing frequent login prompts
- Some providers blocked SMTP connections when HELO hostname was 127.0.0.1
